Process-MyItemList is a versatile PowerShell script designed to efficiently process a list of arbitrary items—anything that can be represented as a text string, such as usernames, computer names, file paths, or other identifiers. Whether you're automating administrative tasks, or performing bulk operations, this script provides a robust foundation for parallel execution.

At its core, Process-MyItemList leverages a customizable Runspace Pool, enabling multi-threaded processing that dramatically improves performance over traditional sequential loops. By distributing workload across concurrent threads, it ensures responsive execution even for large datasets or time-intensive operations.
